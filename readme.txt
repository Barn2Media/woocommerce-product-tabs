Discover the easy way to add extra tabs to your WooCommerce product pages.

WooCommerce Product Tabs lets you add an unlimited number of extra tabs to any or all of your product pages.

Each tab has a WYSIWYG editor which you can use to add absolutely any type of information to the product page. You can add HTML code, shortcodes, images, videos, audio embeds - the possibilities are endless! 

Adding extra tabs to product pages is an excellent way to provide more information to customers without adding clutter or affecting the layout. Here are some examples of popular uses for WooCommerce product tabs:

- **Reassure customers** - Create WooCommerce product page tabs to showcase your certifications, warranty information, 
- **Add social proof to the WooCommerce product page** - Add customers testimonials with photos and videos, or embed social media feeds.
- **Additional order information** - Add a shipping or delivery tab to your product pages, provide location-specific information and maps, or even a product enquiry tab by using WooCommerce Product Tabs with your favorite WordPress contact form plugin. 
- **Company background** - Customers love knowing who they’re ordering from. Add personality to your brand by adding a charitable causes tab, a sustainability tab, or a tab describing your company story and history. 
- **Upsell related products** - Display related products or items from the same collection in an extra tab on the product page. This helps to increase your average order value. 
- **Legal information** - Add extra product page tabs to provide legal information, your returns policy, or financing options.
